# Quantified-Self
This is a study done about myself using data that I collected about myself, and also those from a group.

This is done using R and Python.

- Analysis is done in R
- Azure's facial detection API is called using Python, which first pulls images from S3 bucket

Data taken for analysis are as follows:

<b>Group Data:</b>
GPS Data- From mobile phone, exported from Google
